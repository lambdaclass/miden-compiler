/// This transformation sinks operations as close as possible to their uses, one of two ways:
///
/// 1. If there exists only a single use of the operation, move it before it's use so that it is
///    in an ideal position for code generation.
///
/// 2. If there exist multiple uses, materialize a duplicate operation for all but one of the uses,
///    placing them before the use. The last use will receive the original operation.
///
/// To make this rewrite even more useful, we take care to place the operation at a position before
/// the using op, such that when generating code, the operation value will be placed on the stack
/// at the appropriate place relative to the other operands of the using op. This makes the operand
/// stack scheduling optimizer's job easier.
///
/// The purpose of this rewrite is to improve the quality of generated code by reducing the live
/// ranges of values that are trivial to materialize on-demand.
///
/// # Restrictions
///
/// This transform will not sink operations under the following conditions:
///
/// * The operation has side effects
/// * The operation is a block terminator
/// * The operation has regions
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// Given a list of regions, perform control flow sinking on them. For each region, control-flow
/// sinking moves operations that dominate the region but whose only users are in the region into
/// the regions so that they aren't executed on paths where their results are not needed.
///
/// TODO: For the moment, this is a *simple* control-flow sink, i.e., no duplicating of ops. It
/// should be made to accept a cost model to determine whether duplicating a particular op is
/// profitable.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```mlir
/// %0 = arith.addi %arg0, %arg1
/// scf.if %cond {
///   scf.yield %0
/// } else {
///   scf.yield %arg2
/// }
/// ```
///
/// After control-flow sink:
///
/// ```mlir
/// scf.if %cond {
///   %0 = arith.addi %arg0, %arg1
///   scf.yield %0
/// } else {
///   scf.yield %arg2
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If using the `control_flow_sink` function, callers can supply a callback
/// `should_move_into_region` that determines whether the given operation that only has users in the
/// given operation should be moved into that region. If this returns true, `move_into_region` is
/// called on the same operation and region.
///
/// `move_into_region` must move the operation into the region such that dominance of the operation
/// is preserved; for example, by moving the operation to the start of the entry block. This ensures
/// the preservation of SSA dominance of the operation's results.
